# ruse

Random Userspace Filesystem

## Usage

Try this command, you'll be able to browse a directory sourced from
the RESTful API from the response of images at: https://dog.ceo/api/breed/dane-great/images

This would be a great way to view/edit CRUD documents over other
RESTful endpoints, or even to display database records for editing in
a user's favorite editor.

```
mkdir /tmp/dog-pics && lein run /tmp/dog-pics
```
